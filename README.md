This resume builder project involves building a web page that enables users to create and download their resumes. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
anyone can create an engaging and user-friendly UI that allows users to input their personal details and work experience, edit and modify their content, and preview the final version of their resumes. HTML provides structure and content to the page, CSS defines the layout and styling, and JavaScript allows us to add dynamic behavior to the page, including form validation and customizations based on user inputs. Together, these technologies enable us to create a fully-functional resume builder application that can help users quickly create and tailor their resumes for different job applications and opportunities.
